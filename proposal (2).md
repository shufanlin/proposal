# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title will be "Catch Dumpling".

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A small game to catch dumplings falling from the sky and avoid firecrackers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Players control the direction of the bowl by controlling the keyboard. Dumplings and firecrackers will randomly fall from the sky. The longer they survive, the faster the items will fall. The player has three lives. If three firecrackers are received, the game is over.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

By myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think it takes a lot of time and energy to make a game. I will make at least one game that can run, maybe just catch dumplings and avoid firecrackers. The player will have unlimited lives, and the falling speed of items will not accelerate. Unless the game is closed, the game will not end.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome for my final project is if the player catches three firecrackers and the game ends, at least the game has a beginning and an end.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for my final project is I can make exactly the same game as I described.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to download pygame first. Then through online teaching, learn how to write pygame code, and learn how to insert pictures to make the game more interesting. I hope to make a complete and logical game where players can freely choose to continue the game or quit.
